Realizing interactive whole-body control for multi-humanoid systems is critical for unlocking complex collaborative capabilities in shared environments. Although recent advancements have significantly enhanced the agility of individual robots, bridging the gap to physically coupled multi-humanoid interaction remains challenging, primarily due to severe kinematic mismatches and complex contact dynamics. To address this, we introduce Rhythm, the first unified framework enabling real-world deployment of dual-humanoid systems for complex, physically plausible interactions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) an Interaction-Aware Motion Retargeting (IAMR) module that generates feasible humanoid interaction references from human data; (2) an Interaction-Guided Reinforcement Learning (IGRL) policy that masters coupled dynamics via graph-based rewards; and (3) a real-world deployment system that enables robust transfer of dual-humanoid interaction. Extensive experiments on physical Unitree G1 robots demonstrate that our framework achieves robust interactive whole-body control, successfully transferring diverse behaviors such as hugging and dancing from simulation to reality.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
- **Rhythm Framework:** We propose the first unified framework for whole-body dual-humanoid interaction that achieves the first successful robust transfer of complex interactive behaviors to physical hardware.
- **IAMR & MAGIC Dataset:** We develop **IAMR** (Interaction-Aware Motion Retargeting) to resolve kinematic conflicts and release **MAGIC** (Multi-Humanoid Geometric Interaction Dataset), offering paired raw and retargeted interaction data.
- **IGRL Policy:** We introduce **IGRL** (Interaction-Guided Reinforcement Learning), a multi-agent learning module that masters coupled interaction dynamics via graph-based rewards, enabling agents to learn robust and physically consistent behaviors.
- **Extensive Validation:** We conduct extensive experiments on **Unitree G1** humanoids. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse interaction tasks in both simulation and the real world demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework.
